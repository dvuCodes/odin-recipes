    <p>
      I tip my cap to a certain fast food franchise for coming up with the idea
      for a boneless baby back rib sandwich, the only downside being that they
      use about 60 mystery ingredients-- ribs not necessarily being one of them.
      That's why you should try this easy homemade version with real ribs;
      simply bake, chill, cut, sauce, finish on the grill, and voila! One of the
      best sandwiches I've ever had.
